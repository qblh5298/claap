# Claap AI Sales Assistant: Cut Meeting Time by 20%, Close Deals 30% Faster, Automate Your Sales Workflow

So you're drowning in post-meeting admin work? Yeah, we've all been there. You finish a sales call, feeling pretty good about it, then spend the next 30 minutes typing up notes, updating the CRM, and trying to remember what the prospect actually said about their budget. By the time you're done, you've forgotten half the nuances that might've helped you close the deal.

Enter Claap – an AI-powered meeting assistant that's basically like having a super-attentive colleague who never zones out during calls, takes perfect notes, and even writes your follow-up emails for you. But here's the thing: unlike some AI tools that promise the moon and deliver cheese, Claap actually seems to work. Companies using it report cutting meetings by 20% and boosting win rates up to 30%.

Let me walk you through what this thing actually does and whether it's worth your time (and money).

## What Claap Actually Is (Without the Marketing Fluff)

Claap is a conversation intelligence platform designed specifically for sales teams. It records your meetings, transcribes everything in real-time across 99 languages, generates AI summaries based on customizable templates, and automatically enriches your CRM with the relevant data. Then it goes a step further – analyzing deal health, extracting objections, scoring qualification frameworks like MEDDIC or BANT, and even coaching your reps on what they could do better.

The platform was acquired by lemlist in 2024 for $15 million, which tells you something about its traction. It's now being positioned as the sales intelligence layer for teams that want to work smarter without adding more tools to their already bloated stack.

## Real Talk: What People Are Actually Saying

I dug through user reviews across G2, Product Hunt, and other platforms to get past the marketing spin. Here's what actual users are experiencing:

**The Good Stuff:**

Barbara from Scoreplay mentioned their team cut 20% of meetings with Claap, finding it struck the perfect balance between efficiency and maintaining creative culture. Alejandro, an Account Executive at Surfe, reported shaving 10 days off his sales cycle by replacing 30-minute meetings with 5-minute videos.

Users consistently praise the transcription quality, calling it "top quality" with accurate AI templates. The interface gets thumbs up for being intuitive and clean – people mention getting set up in just two minutes. The collaborative features (comments, video replies, thread discussions) get special attention for making async work actually functional.

**The Not-So-Good:**

There's a learning curve, especially for first-time AI meeting tool users. Some summaries need light editing to match context or tone properly. A few users mentioned the screen recording extension being glitchy – one reviewer described it as "a jigsaw puzzle with no picture and a couple of pieces missing."

Support response times came up as slower than expected. The free plan is pretty limited (10 videos, 300 minutes of recording) compared to competitors like tl;dv.

## Pricing Breakdown: What You'll Actually Pay

Here's where things get interesting. Claap uses a flexible licensing model where different team members can have different licenses. You're not forced to put everyone on the same expensive plan.

| Plan | Monthly (€) | Annual (€) | Best For | Key Limitations |
|------|------------|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| **Basic** | Free | Free | Contributors, occasional users | 10 videos per user, 300 mins recording, 3-month storage |
| **Pro** | €30 | €24 | All teams & leaders | Unlimited recordings, 1000 mins/month, 2-year storage |
| **Business** | €60 | €48 | Sales & revenue teams | Unlimited everything, includes CRM auto-complete, AI coaching, deal insights |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | Custom | Large orgs with security needs | All Business features + SSO, SCIM, white glove onboarding, API access |

**Save 20% by going annual** – that's the standard discount Claap offers, which brings the Business plan down to €48/month instead of €60.

The smart move? Start core revenue team members on Business licenses (€48/month annual) where you need the CRM enrichment and deal insights. Put observers and occasional users on free Basic licenses. This mixed approach lets you scale without the per-seat cost explosion you get with tools like Gong (which runs $100-130/user/month).

## The Features That Actually Matter

Let me cut through the feature list bloat and focus on what moves the needle:

**Meeting Intelligence That Works**
The platform auto-records your calls on Google Meet, Teams, or Zoom without that awkward bot joining. Transcription happens in real-time across 99 languages. But the real magic is in the AI templates – you can set up custom prompts for discovery calls, demos, user research, whatever. The AI then structures the summary exactly how you need it.

**CRM Auto-Enrichment**
This is huge. Instead of manually updating Salesforce or HubSpot after every call, Claap extracts the relevant fields and syncs them automatically. Deal stage, next steps, objections, feature requests – all populated without you lifting a finger.

**Deal Qualification Scoring**
Claap can automatically score your deals against frameworks like MEDDIC, BANT, SPICED. It tells you what's missing in your qualification and surfaces risk factors before they tank your forecast. One user from TenderApp mentioned their SQL-to-win rate jumped from 9% to 15% by identifying which discovery questions actually correlated with closed deals.

**AI Sales Coaching**
The platform analyzes talk-time ratios, identifies successful messaging patterns from your best calls, and provides actionable coaching insights. New reps can browse a library of winning calls to learn faster. It's like having your top performer's playbook accessible to everyone.

**Async Video Updates**
Replace status meetings with quick screen recordings. Share product updates, proposal walkthroughs, or customer success check-ins without coordinating calendars. Recipients can comment at specific timestamps and respond with their own videos.

## How It Stacks Up Against Alternatives

Here's the honest comparison landscape:

**vs. Gong:** Claap costs about 60% less (€48/month vs ~$100/month) while delivering roughly 80% of Gong's capabilities. You lose some of the enterprise-grade forecasting analytics, but gain better async collaboration features and a cleaner interface.

**vs. tl;dv:** tl;dv's Business plan runs $59/month (vs Claap's €48), and while tl;dv has better CRM native integrations, Claap offers more sophisticated deal qualification frameworks and customization options.

**vs. Fireflies:** Fireflies is cheaper at the entry level ($10-19/month), but Claap provides deeper sales-specific features like MEDDIC scoring and structured CRM data fields that Fireflies lacks.

**vs. Fathom:** Fathom wins on simplicity and clean transcripts, but doesn't touch Claap's conversation intelligence depth or sales workflow automation.

The verdict? If you're running a serious sales operation (5+ reps, deals worth $10K+), Claap delivers better ROI than budget options while costing way less than enterprise platforms.

## Who Should Actually Use This

**Perfect fit for:**
- B2B sales teams (5-50 reps) closing mid-to-high-ticket deals
- Revenue leaders who need visibility into why deals win or lose
- Remote/hybrid teams struggling with meeting overload
- Sales ops folks tired of manually updating CRMs
- Teams using MEDDIC, BANT, SPICED or similar frameworks

**Skip it if:**
- You're a solo founder (overkill for your needs)
- You just need basic transcription (Otter is cheaper)
- Your team is 100+ users with complex security requirements (might need Gong's enterprise infrastructure)
- You have zero budget (the free plan is too limited for serious use)

## The Bottom Line

Look, no AI tool is perfect. Claap has its quirks – the screen recorder extension needs work, support could be faster, and some summaries need manual touch-ups. But here's what matters: it actually delivers on its core promise. Teams are cutting meeting time, closing deals faster, and spending way less time on admin drudgery.

At €48/month per user for the Business plan (with the 20% annual discount), it sits in a sweet spot – sophisticated enough for real sales intelligence, affordable enough that one extra deal per quarter pays for your entire team, and flexible enough to scale without forcing everyone onto expensive licenses.

The platform clearly understands sales workflows. Features like MEDDIC scoring, CRM auto-enrichment, and deal risk analysis aren't just checkboxes – they're built by people who've actually done sales and know what data you need when.

If you're serious about sales performance and tired of guessing why deals slip through the cracks, Claap is worth testing. The free plan lets you kick the tires, and the annual commitment gets you meaningful savings.
